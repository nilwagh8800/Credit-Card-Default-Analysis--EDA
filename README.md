# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for Credit Card Default Analysis
The EDA phase involved several key steps to understand the dataset, detect issues, and uncover valuable insights:


Data Inspection:

Check the structure of the dataset, including the number of rows, columns, and the types of variables (numerical vs. categorical).
Display the first few records to understand the data format and initial impressions.
Data Cleaning:

Handle missing values by either removing or imputing missing data based on the type of feature.
Ensure the data types are correct (e.g., categorical features are converted to appropriate data types like category).
Feature Engineering:

Create new features if necessary, based on the existing data (e.g., calculating the ratio of the bill statement to the credit limit).
Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization:

Descriptive Statistics: Generate summary statistics to understand the distribution of numerical features.
Class Imbalance: Visualize the distribution of the target variable (credit default or not), which is likely imbalanced. Consider addressing this imbalance in modeling.
Correlation Analysis: Use heatmaps to show correlations between features and identify which variables are most predictive of credit default.
Outlier Detection:

Visualize and identify outliers in the dataset (for example, using boxplots or Isolation Forest), as these can significantly affect model performance.
Visualization:

Histograms: Explore the distribution of key variables like age, credit limit, and payment amounts.
Bar Plots: Show the distribution of categorical features like education, gender, and marital status.
Correlation Heatmap: Display correlations between numerical features, helping to identify strong relationships with the target variable.
